“name”: “Sir Harry”,
“description”: “Harry Sims \u2014 a wealthy, self-satisfied man about to be knighted. Rotund, confident, and convinced every woman envies his wife and every man envies him. He can’t fathom why anyone would leave all this. Think: a man who has confused being rich with being admirable.”,
“lines”: 130,
“difficulty”: “high”,
“costumeIdeas”: “Nice shirt, blazer or suit jacket. Look prosperous and smug. Puff your chest out. A pocket watch if you have one. Practice bowing.”
},

“name”: “Kate”,
“description”: “A typist \u2014 and Harry’s ex-wife. Calm, witty, self-possessed, and completely unbothered by Harry’s wealth. She carries her typewriter like a friend. She left Harry years ago and has never regretted it. Think: the one who got away, and knows exactly why she left.”,
“lines”: 140,
“difficulty”: “high”,
“costumeIdeas”: “Simple, neat clothes. Nothing fancy. Carry a laptop or tablet as your ‘typewriter.’ Be serene while everyone else is flustered.”

“name”: “Lady Sims”,
“description”: “Harry’s current wife \u2014 nervous, meek, afraid of displeasing her husband. She wears jewels and a presentation gown but has a drawn, shrinking quality. She says very little, but her final line lands like a bomb. Think: a woman slowly waking up.”,

{
“name”: “Narrator”,
“description”: “The voice of J.M. Barrie himself \u2014 arch, witty, and gently devastating. Barrie wrote his stage directions like a novelist, full of sly commentary on his characters.
