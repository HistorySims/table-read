“description”: “Four thieves hide in a remote inn after stealing the ruby eye of a hideous idol from a temple in India. Three priests have followed them across the world to reclaim it. The Toff, a disgraced gentleman, has a plan to deal with the priests. But he has not foreseen everything. A horror play with a slow-building dread and one of the most terrifying endings in one-act theater.”,
“characters”: [
{
“name”: “The Toff”,
“description”: “A. E. Scott-Fortescue – a dilapidated gentleman, educated, clever, and utterly confident. He reads his sporting paper while everyone panics. He masterminded the ruby theft and every plan since. He has never lost a game of cards. He has foreseen everything. Almost. Think: the smartest man in the room, until the room changes.”,
“lines”: 76,
“difficulty”: “high”,
“costumeIdeas”: “Something slightly shabby but once-fine – a worn blazer, a loose tie. Read a newspaper. Speak with calm authority. Never raise your voice until the very end.”
},
{
“name”: “Bill”,
“description”: “William Jones – a merchant sailor, brave and loyal to the Toff. He does the dirty work without flinching. He’s the muscle of the group and the one who actually kills the priests. Think: a tough, practical man who follows orders because he knows the Toff is smarter than him.”,
“lines”: 67,
“difficulty”: “medium”,
“costumeIdeas”: “Rough working clothes. Roll up your sleeves. Speak gruffly. You’re the one who gets things done.”

{
“name”: “Albert”,
“description”: “Albert Thomas – a merchant sailor who thinks he’s cleverer than he is. He gave the priests the slip in Hull, or so he believes. He’s the one who stole the ruby from the idol’s head. Practical and a bit cocky, until the end. Think: a man who boasts about his cunning and then discovers what real cunning looks like.”,
“lines”: 47,
“difficulty”: “medium”,
“costumeIdeas”: “Sailor clothes. Be proud of yourself early on. Your final line – calling out to Toffy as you walk to your death – should break hearts.”

“name”: “Sniggers”,
“description”: “Jacob Smith – a merchant sailor, nervous and jumpy. He doesn’t like this place. He’s the first to see the horror and the first to crack. He tries to give back his share of the ruby. He weeps. Think: the one who knows something is wrong before anyone else, and no one listens.”,
“lines”: 57,
“difficulty”: “medium”,
“costumeIdeas”: “Look uneasy from the start. Glance at windows. When you come back from the garden, you should look like you’ve seen something that broke your mind.”
},
{
“name”: “The Voice”,
“description”: “The voice of Klesh – the idol, calling each thief by his full legal name to come outside and die. Offstage. Calm. Formal. Inhuman. Three lines, each one worse than the last. Think: something ancient and patient reading names from a list.”,
“lines”: 4,
“difficulty”: “easy”,
“costumeIdeas”: “You don’t need a costume – you’re offstage, or facing away from the group. Speak slowly, with an outlandish accent. Be terrifyingly polite.”
