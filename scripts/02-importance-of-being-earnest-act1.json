"characters": [
{
"name": "Algernon",
"description": "Algernon Moncrieff — a languid, witty bachelor who lives for pleasure and cucumber sandwiches. He's clever, self-amused, and always one step ahead. He invented a fake sick friend named Bunbury to escape social obligations. Think: the friend who's always scheming but makes it look effortless.",
"lines": 128,
"difficulty": "high",
"costumeIdeas": "Smoking jacket or velvet blazer, cravat or bow tie, pocket square. A teacup as a prop. Hair slicked back if possible."
},
{
"name": "Jack",
"description": "John (Jack) Worthing — a respectable country gentleman who secretly goes to London under the name 'Ernest' to have fun. He's sincere, a bit flustered, and hopelessly in love with Gwendolen. He's the straight man to Algernon's wit. Think: the responsible friend who's hiding a wild side.",
"lines": 132,
"difficulty": "high",
"costumeIdeas": "Suit jacket and tie, neat and proper. Gloves if you have them. More buttoned-up than Algernon — he's trying to impress."
},
{
"name": "Lane",
"description": "Algernon's manservant — utterly deadpan, unflappable, and drily funny without ever cracking a smile. He has an opinion on everything but delivers it as pure fact. Small role but scene-stealing. Think: a butler who knows more than everyone but will never say so.",
"lines": 22,
"difficulty": "easy",
"costumeIdeas": "White button-down shirt, dark vest or waistcoat, a dish towel over one arm. Stand very straight and speak very evenly."
},
{
"name": "Lady Bracknell",
"description": "Gwendolen's mother and Algernon's aunt — an imposing, opinionated force of nature who runs high society through sheer willpower. She interrogates Jack like a courtroom prosecutor and is horrified to learn he was found in a handbag. The most quotable role. Think: a disapproving aunt turned up to eleven.",
"lines": 58,
"difficulty": "medium",
"costumeIdeas": "A big hat, shawl, or scarf draped dramatically. Reading glasses perched on nose. A notebook and pencil as props for the interrogation scene. Pearls if available."
},
{
"name": "Gwendolen",
"description": "Gwendolen Fairfax — poised, confident, and absolutely certain she will only marry a man named Ernest. She's romantic but on her own terms, and she's sharper than she lets on. She adores Jack but has no idea his name isn't really Ernest. Think: someone who's already planned the wedding and is just waiting for you to catch up.",
"lines": 47,
"difficulty": "medium",
"costumeIdeas": "Something elegant — a nice blouse, a headband, or a flower in the hair. A small handbag or fan as a prop. Poise is the main costume."
